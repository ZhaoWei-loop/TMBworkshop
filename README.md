Three models of increasing complexity implemented in TMB to predict malaria prevalence. 

**Model 1:** Linear regression with covariates

**Model 2:** Linear model with Gaussian field

**Model 3:** Two types of response data. Two contributions to the likelihood. Customised link function. Linear model with Gaussian field and optimised link function
