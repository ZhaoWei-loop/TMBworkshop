Overview
-------

### Data used

Malaria prevalence data: Open-access malaria data hosted by the Malaria Atlas Project https://map.ox.ac.uk/ accessed using the malariaAtlas R package

Malaria incidence data: Open-access data from https://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.82194/PfPvAllData01042015_AgeStand.csv?sequence=1. Saved in the data folder

Covaraite data: TBC


### Structure of the course

Three models of increasing complexity implemented in TMB to predict malaria prevalence. 

**Model 1:** Linear regression with covariates

**Model 2:** Linear model with Gaussian field

**Model 3:** Two types of response data. Two contributions to the likelihood. Customised link function. Linear model with Gaussian field and optimised link function
